# Smarthome

I created this project in my free time because I'm really passionate about the possibilities that Arduino provides. This project is still being updated.
All communication is based on HC-05 Bluetooth modules.

LED Strip effects:
- Colors overflow 
- Pulse
- Static colors
- Screen capture (**Ambi**ent **light**ing)
- Sunrise alarm clock

Climate control. You can connect these devices:
- Air conditioner
- Humidifier
- Heater

I recommend use a 5v relay module for these features.
